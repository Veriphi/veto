## [why Bitcoin?](https://medium.com/@wiz/why-bitcoin-359ada12629e)

### Money
* Bitcoin is a form of Money. The US & Canadian Dollar & Gold are other forms of Money.
* Money is any object that serves the following three objectives :
  * Store of Value. (When you produce value, how do you keep it?)
  * Medium of Exchange. (How do you exchange value in situations other than troc?)*
  * Unit of account (How do you compare the value between different goods?)
  
### Fiat Money
* Our current monetary system, either the US Dollar, or Canadian Dollar or Chinese Yuan, have no intrinsic value and are simply numbers on a screen or paper. They all share a government seal and that’s the reason why the market values them.
* They aren’t credit that the government guarantees at all, the government simply promises that they will handle it responsibly and people either trust it or not.
* Governments don’t decide on money’s value, the whole market does. Government is an actor of the market that tries to influence money’s value and can succeed effectively but can also fail dramatically. 
* Many cases have shown, such as Venezuela recently, that markets can lose confidence in the government and its ability to safely manage the monetary policy. 
* When countries are presented to a bad economic situation, a common Keynesian reaction is to lower interest rates. This basically means they’re inviting anyone to take loans to repump the economy by business investing or consuming, and they’re giving out these loans with money printed.
* When governments print money, they reduce the value of the unit because a unit doesn’t represent any particular value, the sum of all money represents a particular value. If more money comes in through supply emission, dilution happens.
Governments always end up printing too much money and devalue their currency.

### Gold
* There’s also gold, people have used gold for thousands of years and still do, but mostly for the store of value use case. Why? * Because no one can manipulate gold’s supply, nature creates it and it’s extremely rare. Also, gold is always at maximum extraction, compared to other commodities like Diamonds or Silver, that if demand arises, supply can arise as well. If gold demands arise, supply doesn’t change at all, supply is already at maximum.
* Gold is unpractical for the medium of exchange thus for the unit of account use case :
  * Heavy to transport and physically limited. 
  * Hard to divide. 
* Also limited on store of value : Hard to hide so easy to seize by gov/thieves.

### Bitcoin
* Bitcoin has existed since 2009. There can only be 21 million units and there’s a predictable supply schedule, there’s around 18 million currently on the market, 3 million still left to ‘’extract’’. 
* Bitcoin is rarer than Gold. 
* Bitcoin doesn’t have limits of gold because it’s digital :
  * It consumes no physical space, so easy to hide and transport.
  * You can send it from one side of the planet to the other.
  * It’s extremely easy to divide.
* Bitcoin is the superior form of money, it fixes the problems with the current monetary system but keeps the values that made the world switch from Gold to Fiat.
* Bitcoin achieves this in a decentralized form, through cryptography and game theory mostly, described in a protocol of rules.
