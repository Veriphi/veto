# Veto

## Development

### Requirements

- `yarn`
- `node`
- `git`
- `bash`
- `docker`

### Structure

We use yarn workspaces to split the codebase into packages.
Each packages are located in the `packages/` folder.

#### Convention

- Packages under the `packages/shared/` folder are meant to be shared across application and library.
- Packages matching `packages/*-app` are self contained applications and should not be shared across packages.
- Packages matching `packages/veto-*` are part of the veto application and should not be shared across packages.
  - _At some point we might move them to `packages/veto/*`_

### Installation

- Clone this repo
- `yarn install`

### Start the application

#### Running in dev mode

If this is your first time running the project you will probably need to setup cyphernode if you are developing features that require communicating with it. See the Cyphernode setup section below.
Once cyphernode is setup, you can run cyphernode, the backend, and the frontend with:
`yarn dev`
The backend will be accessible on `localhost:8080` and will serve the frontend at `/`
The frontend will be accessible with hot module reloading on `localhost:3000`

Remember to run `yarn cyphernode:stop` when you are finished or the whole cyphernode suite of containers will continue running.

#### Veto

Run this command at the root of the project to start both front-end and back-end,
`yarn start`

Screen app need to be started independently as it capture the whole terminal and would collide with backend & frontend logs
`yarn start:screen`

To run front end on its own
`yarn start:frontend`

To run back end on its own
`yarn start:backend`

##### Config

Configuration is provided through environment variables.
Each variables can be found in the config file `./packages/veto-backend/src/utils/config.ts`

#### Cyphernode

##### Setup cyphernode

From the root of the project, run the following commands:

- `yarn cyphernode:setup`

##### Start cyphernode

When the setup is completed, start cyphernode with the start script

- `yarn cyphernode:start`

##### Credentials

Cyphernode dev credentials are

- Username: `veriphi-dev`
- Password: `veriphirocks!`

### Build the application

To build the application run `./scripts/setup.sh`
This will build veto's docker image and run cyphernode's setup script
Options:
| Name | Default | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CFG_PASSWORD` | `""` | Any string | Password used to seal Cypherdone's config.7z file |
| `SKIP_CYPHERNODE` | `"false"` | `"false" || "false"` | If `true`, cyphernode will not be built |
| `VERSION_NUMBER` | `"latest"` | Any string | Version used to tag both `veto` & `veto-screen` docker image |

To start the application run `./scripts/start.sh`
This will start veto and cyphernode
By default the application is exposed through port 80.
| Name | Default | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `START_SCREEN` | `"false"` | `"false" || "false"` | If `true`, `veto-screen` will be started after `veto` |
| `SKIP_CYPHERNODE` | `"false"` | `"false" || "false"` | If `true`, cyphernode will not be built |
| `VERSION_NUMBER` | `"latest"` | Any string | Version used to tag both `veto` & `veto-screen` docker image |

You can now navigate to `localhost` in your web browser to use the app.
The api is available at `localhost/api`

### Rules

- API urls in `veto-backend` always start with `api/` to separate them from the static files which are on `/`
- Static file path (frontend files) can't start with `api/`, this is to prevent route resolution problems with `veto-backend`.
